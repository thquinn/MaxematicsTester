A while ago, I playtested my card game, Maxematics, with some friends. It was fun, but pretty wildly unbalanced. I figured a computer would know how to balance it better than I would, so I wrote this little tool to simulate thousands and thousands of hands. A little experiment in computer-assisted game design!
